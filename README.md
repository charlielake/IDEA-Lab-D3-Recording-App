# IDEA-Lab-D3-Recording-App

Web recording app written with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vonage API, D3 robot API.

The sidebar files describe the computer of the individual calling into the robot. Note that this is opened on the individual during the call, and as such, the dimensions of the page are based on the dimensions of the window opened during the call - opening this in a web browser might give strange dimensions. "Image of Driver View" shows the dimensions as they appear in call (on the right-side of the screen).
The d3 files describe the robot-side of the call.
The sidebar and d3 webpages interact with each other throughout the call, responding and updating to match the other side when one side presses the recording button.
